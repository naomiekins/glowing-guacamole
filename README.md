# ðŸ“Œ My Chroma + Ollama HackerNews Project

This project sets up a **local AI environment** using [ChromaDB](https://www.trychroma.com/) as a vector database, [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) as a local LLM, and Python scripts to fetch **HackerNews** data and query it with AI.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Fetch top HackerNews stories from the public API.
- Store stories (title, url, score) into **ChromaDB**.
- Query Chroma for relevant stories using keywords.
- Chat with **Ollama** locally (no API key required).
